# The-Big-Bang
Made with c++ SDL 2.0

One of my first projects made in 02/2018 as part of C++ course. 
I chose c++ because that is something I knew back from university and I felt comfortable to try and get back in coding with it.
This project uses SDL library. Below is a link on how to setup SDL to actually get this project working.

The result should look something like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYesRExCPcI

p.s. Tested by myself on fresh machine and by following the tutorial it should work out!
